The goal is to write a program that can take any page on wikipedia and compute 
the number of links to the "Kevin Bacon" wikipedia entry 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bacon).

For example there is a one link separation between Footloose
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footloose_(1984_film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footloose_(1984_film)) and Kevin Bacon.

There is a two link separation between Tom Cruise and Kevin Bacon
[via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Few_Good_Men](via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Few_Good_Men).

We might ask the program how many links there are between Kevin Bacon and
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal)
or any other Wikipedia page, etc.

Inputs to the program will be a wikipedia url and outputs should be an integer.
